# Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Project

This document details the steps followed in a multivariate time series forecasting project, covering data loading, preprocessing, analysis, and modeling.

## 1. Importing Required Libraries
```python
import pandas as pd
```
### Explanation:
We import the `pandas` library to handle data manipulation tasks throughout the project.

## 2. Loading the Data
```python
# Loading the stocks data
stocks_data = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\daksh\Desktop\Project\stocks.csv")
```
### Explanation:
The data is loaded from a CSV file into a `DataFrame`. This dataset includes historical stock information with columns for stock ticker, date, open, high, low, close, adjusted close, and volume.

## 3. Previewing the Data
```python
stocks_data.head()
```
**Output:**
The preview displays the first five rows of the data, showing columns such as `Ticker`, `Date`, `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Adj Close`, and `Volume`.

### Explanation:
Previewing data helps verify the import was successful and provides a first look at the data structure.

## 4. Converting Date Column to DateTime Format
```python
# Changing data type of date column to date time for analysis
stocks_data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(stocks_data['Date'])
```
### Explanation:
To facilitate time-based analysis, the `Date` column is converted to datetime format, which enables easier indexing and manipulation for time series forecasting.

## 5. Checking for Missing Values
```python
# Calculating number of missing values in each column
missing_values = stocks_data.isnull().sum()
print(missing_values)
```
**Output:**
Displays the count of missing values per column.

### Explanation:
Identifying missing values is crucial for handling incomplete data, ensuring the model has accurate and complete information for training.
